## Running the app

The app is bootstrapped using create-next-app. So all next.js commands are available. 

```npm run dev``` to run in dev mode
```npm run build``` to build production bundle
```npm run start``` to build production and serve
```npm run lint``` to run eslint

## Stack details

Server side rendering is done using Next.js
CSS-in-JS using styled-components
Axios is the http client being used
No css library or framework has been used

## Left to do

Unit tests are pending due to time constraints
